[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](http://saltysplits.com/)

SaltySplits is a powerful Python library for the modeling of LiveSplit files and analysis of the speedrunning data within. It also features an experimental front-end (available at [saltysplits.com](https://saltysplits.com/)). 

## Key features
- Modeling, not parsing: LSS's XML structure is explicitely modeled through [`pydantic-xml`](https://github.com/dapper91/pydantic-xml), allowing us to validate all elements and attributes within
- Lossless representation: appropriate types with serialization/validation logic for selected LSS elements and attributes, allowing for lossless decoding and encoding of speedrunning data
- Dataframe representation: Option to bundle all splits per run (normally scattered across all segments) as a single [`pandas.DataFrame`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html) and customize their representation. Choose between game time or real time, cumulative or split time and exclude partial and/or empty runs. Can then be dumped to common file formats for further analysis (e.g. CSV or Excel's XLSX)
- Data visualization: optional front-end with visualizations for lifetime, run and segment statistics, powered by [`Vega-Altair`](https://altair-viz.github.io/) and [`streamlit`](https://streamlit.io/)

## Planned features (in order of priority)
- Front-end option to upload multiple LSS files and compare runs across (online and offline) sources 
- Include dynamic elements in the `pydantic_xml` models (e.g. _Metadata_, _AutoSplitterSettings_; would allow us to update and even create entirely new LSS files through `saltysplits`)
- Decoding of LSS' _GameIcon_/_Segment.Icon_ elements and representing them as `PIL.Image` fields
- Add more meaningful statistics / visualizations to front-end
- Add run validation utilities (e.g. assert that _Attempt.ended_ - _Attempt.started_ matches summed splits for a given run, flag improbable splits, etc.)
- Replace prototype front-end (likely with [`django-ninja`](https://django-ninja.dev/) back-end, builds on top of the existing [`pydantic`](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) stack)

## Installation
```bash
# Install from PYPI with Python's package installer
pip install saltysplits
```

## Example of usage

SaltySplits is roughly split into two parts, the `saltysplits` module and its optional`streamlit` front-end. 

### Python module

After importing the library, we have to locate an LSS file that we'd like to validate and/or analyse. You can [export your own through LiveSplit](#exporting-your-lss-file-from-livesplit) or use the DEMO_SPLITS file included in the library.


```python
import saltysplits as ss
from saltysplits import DEMO_SPLITS

# Loading (and validating) LSS file
splits = ss.read_lss(lss_path=DEMO_SPLITS) 
```

If the content passes the validation, it returns a `pydantic` model instance that holds all LSS elements and attributes along with other class methods for data representation (e.g. `to_df`) These elements and attributes can be accessed through dot notation or through indexing, here are some examples.


```python
# Getting the first split of the first run (i.e. Time instance)
print(splits.segments[0].segment_history[0])

# Getting your attempt count
print(splits.attempt_count)

# Getting your last attempt (i.e. Attempt instance)
print(splits.attempt_history[-1])

# Getting all split_times for the first segment (list of SplitTime instances).
# Any comparisons that you added in LiveSplit will show up here (DEMO_SPLITS only includes 'Personal Best')
print(splits.segments[0].split_times)
```

    Time(real_time=Timedelta('0 days 00:00:54.279395'), game_time=Timedelta('0 days 00:00:54.279395'), id='2')

    51

    Attempt(real_time=Timedelta('0 days 01:17:44.116000'), game_time=None, id='47', started=datetime.datetime(2016, 2, 3, 2, 18, 25), is_started_synced=False, ended=datetime.datetime(2016, 2, 3, 3, 36, 12), is_ended_synced=True)

    [SplitTime(real_time=Timedelta('0 days 00:00:52.605000'), game_time=None, name='Personal Best')]

SaltySplits includes lossless serialization logic for most LSS elements and attributes, allowing us to dump their data to JSON, XML and even LSS. Here are some examples.


```python
# Serialize the first split of the first run (indentation is just to prettify it)
print(splits.segments[0].segment_history[0].model_dump_json(indent=4))

# Serialize the last attempt
print(splits.attempt_history[-1].model_dump_json(indent=4))
```

    {
        "real_time": "00:00:54.2793950",
        "game_time": "00:00:54.2793950",
        "id": "2"
    }
    
    {
        "real_time": "01:17:44.1160000",
        "game_time": null,
        "id": "47",
        "started": "02/03/2016 02:18:25",
        "is_started_synced": "False",
        "ended": "02/03/2016 03:36:12",
        "is_ended_synced": "True"
    }
    

The `SaltySplits` model instance also gives you the option to bundle all splits per run (normally scattered across all segments) and make them available as a single `pandas.DataFrame` with some options for representation/filtering. Here are some examples.

```python
# Exporting as cumulative times
dataframe = splits.to_df(cumulative=True)

# Displaying first three segments for the first three runs
dataframe.iloc[:, :3].head(3)
```

Since we represent time with `pandas.TimeDelta`, we can easily compute some interesting statistics. Here are a few examples.

```python
# Exporting complete runs 
dataframe = splits.to_df(cumulative=False)

# Display top 5 complete runs
print(dataframe.sum(axis=0).sort_values().head(5))
```


    34      0 days 01:20:16.868000
    45      0 days 01:21:08.828000
    43      0 days 01:22:54.734000
    42      0 days 01:23:45.617000
    27   0 days 01:24:15.563029600
    dtype: timedelta64[ns]


```python
# Exporting complete AND partial runs 
dataframe = splits.to_df(cumulative=False, allow_partial=True)

# Getting best split for all segments (including those in partial runs)
best_segments = dataframe.min(axis=1)

# Calculating life playtime
print(dataframe.sum(axis=0).sum())

# Display best splits per segment (limited to 3)
print(best_segments.head(3))

# Getting the best run 
complete_runs = dataframe.loc[:, ~dataframe.isna().any()]  
complete_run_times = complete_runs.sum(axis=0)
best_run_index = complete_run_times.argmin()
best_run = complete_runs.iloc[:, best_run_index]

# Computing time loss for all segments in best run 
best_diffs = best_run - best_segments
possible_timesave = best_diffs.sum()
print(possible_timesave)
```
    Timedelta('1 days 16:00:59.502299300')

Lastly, you can switch between GameTime and RealTime (we currently default to RealTime) and choose to represent time as strings (useful if you want to continue analysis elsewhere).


```python
# Exporting GameTime with LSS representation (with the option to drop nanoseconds)
dataframe = splits.to_df(lss_repr=True, lss_ns=True, time_type=ss.TimeType.GAME_TIME)

# Displaying first three segments for the first three runs
print(dataframe.iloc[:, :3].head(3))
```
